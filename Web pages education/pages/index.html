	<p class="textabout"><span>began</span> as an experiment in online learning, when Stanford instructors Sebastian Thrun and Peter Norvig elected to offer their "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence" course online to anyone, for free. Over 160,000 students in more than 190 countries enrolled.<div id="about1"> The potential to educate at a global scale was awe-inspiring, and Udacity was founded to pursue a mission to democratize education.
